# Introduction to Computational Cognitive Modeling 

This repository is a collection of (mostly) julia scripts used for teaching the Computational Cognitive Modeling course offered at
the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas. Tutorials for each script are hosted at https://coinslab.github.io/CognitiveModelingLabWebsite/ 

NB: Any file that has demo somewhere in its file name should be opened with Pluto.jl
